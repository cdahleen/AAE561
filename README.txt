# AAE561 Final Code README
To run the code discussed in the project presentation and report, using MATLAB, 
simply run the script titled ‘MainScript3D.m’, which will call all relevant functions.
Please note that it is required that CVX be installed in MATLAB.  
For detailed comments of the optimization, see ‘convex_ot3DCVX.m’
Note that there is excess code in this folder for progress tracking
purposes.  Files including 2D path generation or optimization are not
part of the final executable but were used extensively in the devlopment
of the final project
